# Comment Style

Write comments in **English**, clean and structured.

## File Headers
```c
/**
 * filename.c - Brief description
 * Key implementation details
 */
```

## Sections
```c
// --- Section Name ---
// === Major Section ===
```

## Rules
- ❌ No trivial comments on obvious code
- ✅ Explain WHY, not WHAT
- ✅ Comment complex algorithms only
